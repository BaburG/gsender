["### 1.4.12 (March 10th, 2025)","- Added new machine profiles for Altmill 2X4","- Added support for new rotary track options","- Added fallback for jog values in cases where they were undefined.","- Added EEPROM settings export with diagnostic","- Fixed stepover for rotary surfacing on closed loop motors converting unnecessarily","-","### 1.4.11 (December 16th, 2024)","- Added \"Skip Dialog\" option to code toolchange which combines both blocks and skips the \"Continue\" dialog","- Diagnostics now generates a zip file which includes the original diagnostic PDF, a copy of current gSender settings, and any loaded toolpath for better support.","- Continuous jogging now bitwise compares homing location to avoid non-XYZ axes causing invalid corner detection.","- You are now able to update EEPROM values using the firmware tool when in Alarm state.","- Start from line now starts the spindle after the Z safe movement but before X and Y.","- Fix for A axis jog keybinds not working on standard GRBL controller.","- Reverted HAL changes $G using the realtime alternative to reduce instances of error 1 since it was not playing nicely with the new line parser.","- Fix for available axes and axes count not being emitted properly when disconnecting and reconnecting over ethernet.","- Auto Zero touch plate probing now properly converts bit diameter when using imperial preferred units and a specific bit size.","- Available ports are now case insensitive when matching known controller types (Thanks Dymk!)","- Macros no longer overflow the macro widget.","- Tweak to 30X30 machine profile for missing acceleration change for $111.","- Fixed rare situation where connecting to grblHAL controller, disconnecting, and reconnecting to GRBL controller caused invalid laser/spindle mode toggle behaviour.","### 1.4.10 (October 28, 2024)","- Jog no longer sends double jog commands on touch devices","- $G output emitted to UI when connected using grblHAL and manually sent","- Altmill profile updated $103 A steps to account for compiled microstepping","- SLB profiles updated with new values","- Updated defaults on Mk2, Mk1, and MillOne profiles","- AutoZero touch routine updated when running specific diameter bits to be more accurate, and retract distance on Z slightly increased for non-tip routines.","- Rotary toggle no longer updates values when cancelled on grblHAL.","- Changed Spindle/Laser toggle behaviour for when to use gSender settings vs EEPROM settings for laser offset and spindle/laser min and max.","- Custom theme visualizer background now saving correctly.","- Altmill profile now at top of profiles with other Sienci Machines"]
