Run Dev Enviornment
- Make sure you are using gitbash, as there are some permission issues on powershell for some reason
- Use yarn instead of npm or any other package manager for now
- Run yarn install in the root directory to make sure the node modules are installed
- Run yarn dev to start the development enviornment
- The app will be running on port 8000 (http://localhost:8000)
